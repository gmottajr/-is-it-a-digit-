# String Digit Check Challenge in Python :snake:

## Description :page_facing_up:
Welcome to the Python String Digit Check Challenge! This challenge involves implementing the `is_digit` function, which should return `true` if the given string is a single digit (0-9), and `false` otherwise.

:dart: **Goal**: Create a Python function `is_digit` that accurately identifies if a given string is a single digit.

## Requirements :memo:
- Python 3.x
- Basic understanding of Python string manipulation

    # Your code goes here

## Setup :wrench:

    Fork or clone this repository to your local environment.
    Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
    Implement the is_digit function in a Python file.

## Testing :test_tube:

Please ensure you write unit tests to verify your function. Cover edge cases and aim for your code to pass all tests.

## Contribution :handshake:

Contributions are highly appreciated! Feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request with your enhancements or fixes. Make sure to follow the Python coding standards and write tests for new features.
